# CS-370-Final-Project-

•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In our final project, we were asked to create a Q training algorithm that will help our agent solve a maze in the Treasure Hunt Game. In this game the rules were that the agent could only move in one direction at one time (left, right, up, down) If the agent is successful in its move it will try to guess which spot to go on next, if the agent is unsuccessful, then it will take that data and use it on the next epoch. We were given the GameExperiance.py file and the TreasureMaze.py file to help us get started. Then as stated above, we created a Q-training algorithm that helps our agent solve the maze (file is attached) 

•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist research fundamental computer and information scientists. This could be done in many field sch as theorists, designers, or inventors. Computer scientists will often find a solution to a problem by creating software application for desktop or mobile. This job is important because as the world’s reliance grows for into tech, the mor people we will need to make sure that the software is up to date and make sure that it is being used in ethical ways.
o	

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
We first must fully understand what our problem is before we think of any solutions we might implement. After the problem is analyzed, we should document and test our process throughout and make any necessary changes, constantly challenging ourselves to make sure we are doing things not only correctly but in the most efficient ways. 
o	

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethically we are responsible for making sure that any users data is kept safe. There must also be transparency to the user on how exactly their data is going to be used and what context it will be used in. There are more and more data attacks every year and making sure we have secure software is an important part in the developmental process.
